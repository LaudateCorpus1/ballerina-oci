# Module Overview

The Oracle Object Storage Services connector allows you to work with Oracle Object Storage Service API through Ballerina. The following section provides you with the details on connector operations.

The Oracle Object Services connector allows you to work with the following Oracle cloud resources:
- Bucket
- Object

**Bucket Operations**

The `oracle/objectstorage` module contains operations that work with Buckets. You can create, delete, get, list.

**Object Operations**

The `oracle/objectstorage` module contains operations that work with Objects. You can create, delete, get, list.

## Running Sample

Let's get started with a simple program in Ballerina to get a bucket.

Add the below dependency in your Ballerina.toml file.

```[dependencies]
"oracle/core" = { path = "https://github.com/oracle/ballerina-oci/target/objectstorage-2019r3-any-0.1.0.balo", version = "0.1.0"}
```

You can use the `oracle/objectstorage` module to integrate with Oracle Object Storage Services. Import the `oracle/objectstorage` module into the Ballerina project.

```ballerina
import oracle/objectstorage;
```

```ballerina
import ballerina/io;
import oracle/objectstorage;

objectstorage:OciConfiguration ociConfig = {
    host: "",
    tenancyId: "",
    authUserId: "",
    keyFingerprint: "",
    pathToKey: "",
    keyStorePassword: "",
    keyAlias: "",
    keyPassword: ""
};
   
objectstorage:Client ociClient = new(ociConfig);

public function main() {

    ociClient->getObjectStorageBucket(<compartmentId>, <tenancy>, <bucketName>);

}
```

#### Before you Begin

1. Sign up for an oracle account by visiting <https://myservices.us.oraclecloud.com/mycloud/signup?sourceType=_ref_coc-asset-opcSignIn&language=en>
2. You need to get host core url based on region and credentials such as tenancy ID, authorized user ID, key fingerprint, path to key, keystore password, key alias and key password.
3. In the directory wher eyou have your sample, create a `ballerina.conf` file and add the details you obtained from your account and instructions below.

**Obtaining Account IDs**

Follow link instructions to generate API signing key, upload public key, get key fingerprint and retrieve tenancy and user OCID's. 
https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm

**Creating PEM key and converting to PKCS12 format**

https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm#How3

1. openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem -aes128 2048
use this to create a PEM key WITH a password
add the public key to your account!

2. openssl pkcs12 -export -nocerts -inkey ~/.oci/<KEY_NAME>.pem -in ~/.oci/<KEY_NAME>.pem -out ~/.oci/<KEY_NAME_P12>.p12 -name "<KEY_ALIAS>"

This converts the PEM to PKSC12 with the alias/name
Will prompt for the PEM password
Will prompt you for a keystore password

# Ballerina Configuration File
You can now enter the credentials in the Oracle core ballerina.conf file:
```ballerina
HOST_CORE="iaas.<REGION - e.g.us-ashburn-1>.oraclecloud.com"
TENANCY_ID=""
AUTHUSER_ID=""
KEYFINGERPRINT=""
PATHTOKEY=""
KEYSTOREPASSWORD=""
KEYALIAS=""
KEYPASSWORD=""
```
